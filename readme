project euler
---------------------

* main.js is just a wrapper. i might add some sort of functionality to it
* problems each have their own files & are under problems.

javascript notes
-------------------------

since this is to be a learning process, might as well document as i go. might eventually migrate some stuff to the enyclopedia


packaging / importing stuff
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

package.json vs package-lock.json
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* see `this article <https://medium.com/coinmonks/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-package-lock-json-b81911aa8ab8>`_ for  good summary of what that's about. The short story is:
    * package-lock.json is what gets installed as dependancies when you import/run the program
    * package-lock.json is generated from package.json (I think?)
    * if package.json has been updated, then it trumps package-lock.json
    * the main difference between the 2 is that package.json only cares that the versions of the dependancies you use match for major versions ( M.m.p, where M==major version, m=minors, p=patches), while package-lock.json is a complete freeze
    * commit both to your git.


things to checkout
--------------------------

#. ECMAScript6 vs other engines, what's what
#. ESLint, what does it do why I should use it
#. import syntaxes & differences
#. package.json - what/why/how

eslint
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* spent ~30minutes, doesn't quite work. will check on Atari instead & see if I'm missing something obvious. I can't figure out what the eslint configuration file should be.
